What Do We (Not) Know About Research Software Engineering?. Journal of Open Research Software, 10(1), p.11.DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/jors.384**

Workshop/forum on research software engineering. Gathered issues, with emphasis on personnel matters and policy/resource prioritization. Specific questions raised are provided here: https://github.com/NLeSC/RSE-research. Interesting questions include:

* Do RSEs work exclusively in academia or is there a significant proportion of RSEs working in industry on research-aligned software?
* How are RSE groups funded?
* What software should be preserved and/or maintained? What criteria to decide on this?

Something like: greater community activity is a pillar of software sustainability. Projects that are forked last longer, and can live on beyond their demises.

Generally, lots of good advice. Importance of active maintenance for perception of quality. Testing. Readability. Adherence to idioms/standards.
